Eloi GARANDEL / Antoine BELLANGER

The goal of this project is to implement a program capable of recognizing handwritten digits. It was done using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm paired with a pre-classified dataset of digits.

- knn.pdf is the assignment pdf
- The src folder contains all code files (KNN is the main program and KNNClustering the bonus part of the assignment)
